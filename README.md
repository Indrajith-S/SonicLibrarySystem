# SONIC LIBRARY SYSTEM

The Sonic Library System is an innovative project designed to monitor and manage sound levels within a library environment. It involves placing Arduino units on each library table to accurately sense and measure sound levels. These units then transmit this data to a central hub, which is typically managed by a librarian or library staff.
## Functions

The main functions of the Sonic Library System are:

- Sound Level Monitoring: The Arduino units continuously monitor the sound levels at each table in the library. This real-time data is collected and sent to the central hub, providing an up-to-date overview of the noise levels throughout the library.

- Data Visualization: The central hub's software provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to monitor and manage sound levels across the library. Instead of using traditional graphical representations, the system employs a color-coded approach, i.e, green, orange, and red to indicate the noise levels at each table. This approach offers a quick and easily understandable visual snapshot of the library's noise situation.

- Remote Management: The librarian can interact with the system's software to take appropriate actions. By clicking on specific tables on the software interface, the librarian can reset the sound levels at those tables. This capability empowers the librarian to proactively manage noise disruptions without physically visiting each table.

- Efficiency and Decorum Maintenance: The Sonic Library System aims to reduce the need for constant manual monitoring and intervention by library staff. This automated approach contributes to maintaining a quieter and more conducive environment for studying and reading, enhancing the overall decorum of the library.

## Target Audience

- The Sonic Library System primarily caters to libraries, educational institutions, and other similar quiet environments. Its target audience includes:

- Librarians and Library Staff: The system assists librarians and staff in efficiently managing noise levels within the library, allowing them to focus on other tasks while ensuring a peaceful environment.

- Library Patrons: Library users benefit from the project as well, as it helps maintain a quieter and more conducive atmosphere for studying, reading, and research.

- Educational Institutions: The system can be adopted by schools, colleges, and universities to ensure that their libraries provide an optimal environment for learning and concentration.

## Summary

In conclusion, the Sonic Library System stands as a technological marvel, seamlessly integrating Arduino-based table sensors and a centralized hub. Its innovative approach transforms noise management, offering a real-time color-coded visualization of noise levelsâ€”green for serenity, orange for moderation, and red for potential disruption. Librarians wield proactive control, ensuring a tranquil atmosphere that enhances the library's essence as a sanctuary for both staff and patrons.
